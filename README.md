Very basic preprocessing and 3D Convolutional Neural Network based off of tutorial from: https://pythonprogramming.net/3d-convolutional-neural-network-machine-learning-tutorial/

## r version

More advanced preprocessing resizing slices and transforming pixels into Hiensfeld Units.  Function creates one complete dataframe of flattened, transformed images for use in the kaggle competition.
